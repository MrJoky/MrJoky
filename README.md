- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrJoky alias Timo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things but to brake it down to a few words: Webdevelopment, Music, Gaming, and entertaining.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all Frontendbased languages and so on. My HTML and CSS Skills are allready on a propper level, but JS is far away from being masterd... 

I'm a beginner looking for some new ways to learn coding. I'll put all my written things public so people can help me (or maybe learn from me?).
