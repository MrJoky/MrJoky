- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrJoky alias Timo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things but to brake it down to a few words: Webdevelopment, Music, Gaming, and entertaining.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all Frontendbased languages and so on. My HTML and CSS Skills are allready on a propper level, JS is getting better and better ...
      My next steps are to master React and Angular. Let's step up the game!!

One year into the job as a Junior Frontend-Dev/UI-UX Designer. My expirience made a huge growth, but there is still a lot to learn. I'm gratefull to have good Mentors that teach me an push me to do better!
