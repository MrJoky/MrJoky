- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrJoky alias Timo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things but to brake it down to a few words: Webdevelopment, Music, Gaming, and entertaining.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all Frontendbased languages and so on. My HTML and CSS Skills are allready on a propper level, but JS is far away from being masterd... 

I just startet a Job as a Junior Frontend-Dev/UI-UX Designer. I'm happy to be in this Job. It's a creat oportunity to master my skills. So for now i'm not going to be very present here.
